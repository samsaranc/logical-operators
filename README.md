The challenge: assemble a robot from LEGO® MINDSTORMS® parts and design and implement an algorithm to navigate a maze from any starting point, find a silver target, turn around, and return using the quickest route possible. All code for the maze-navigation programs was in Java.

This video shows the Logical Operators' robot successfully navigating the maze, reaching the target, and returning as quickly as possible. 

The Logical Operators are Samsara Counts (leader), Cal Lohrmann, Mike Fan, and Abigail Smallman, Computer Science students  in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the George Washington University.
